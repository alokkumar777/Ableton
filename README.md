## GSAP Animations

This project uses GSAP to provide fade-in animations. To use them, add the following classes to your HTML elements:

- `.gsap-fade-in`: A generic fade-in effect.
- `.gsap-fade-in-button`: A fade-in effect with a slight upward movement, suitable for buttons.
- `.gsap-fade-in-text`: A fade-in effect with a slight upward movement, suitable for text elements.
- `.gsap-fade-in-image`: A fade-in effect with a slight scaling effect, suitable for images.

The animations are defined in `scripts/animations.js` and are automatically applied to elements with these classes when the page loads.
